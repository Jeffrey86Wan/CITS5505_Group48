Here’s some helpful tips to keep your account safe
1.  Check your account statements and transactions regularly. Any suspicious transactions or fraudulent activity? Please call 
us immediately on 1300 308 008.
2. Set up account alerts to help monitor and protect your accounts.
3.		Never	share	your	security	information	and	passcodes	like	PINs,	passwords,	verification	codes	or	your	full	username	with 	
anyone.
4. Always keep your security information and passcodes safe. Never record them without protection.
5.  Choose strong and unique passwords that no one else can guess. Do not use your name or birth date and consider 
using passphrases.
6. Remember to change your passwords often.
7.  Stop, challenge and protect. If you’re unsure who’s contacting you, stop and check with someone you trust or contact the 
organisation directly.
Remember, HSBC will never ask you for your security information or passcodes. If you’re being pressured, it’s most likely 
a scam. If you fail to protect your security information and passcodes, or disclose your passcodes to anyone, you may be 
liable for your losses. For any unauthorised transactions, liability will be determined under the ePayments Code.
